# Irsi-Flower-Classification
This is a Iris Flower Classification project. The Iris Flower Classification project is a common introductory project for data science and machine learning. It involves classifying iris flowers among three species based on the length and width of their sepals and petals. Here are some detailed steps and considerations for this project, which could be part of a data science internship:

**Overview:** <br>
* Objective: Classify iris flowers into three species: Iris setosa, Iris versicolor, and Iris virginica. <br>
* Dataset: Iris dataset, which contains 150 samples, with 50 samples for each species. Each sample has four features: <br>
1. Sepal length <br>
2. Sepal width <br>
3. Petal length <br> 
4. Petal width <br>
